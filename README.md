### Naive definition of probability (p6)
$$
P_{naive}(A) = \frac{\lvert A \rvert}{\lvert S \rvert} = \frac{\text{No. of outcomes in favor of} A}{\text{total number of outcomes in }S}
$$

### Multiplication rule (P8)
If we have a compound experiment consisting of Experiment A with $a$ outcomes and Experiment B with $b$ outcomes, the possible outcomes will be $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
