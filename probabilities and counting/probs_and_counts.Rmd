# Factorials and binomial coefficients
Computing $n!$ is done by using the function factorial(n), and the binomial coefficient is done by using 

```{r}
factorial(n)
choose(n,k)
```

# Sampling and simulation
The *sample* command is used in the following way:
```{r}
n <- 50; k <- 7
sample(n,k)
```

This draws an ordered sample of 7 of the numbers from 1 to 50, without replacement and equal probabilities given to each
